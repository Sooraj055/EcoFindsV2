Project Description
EcoFinds is a sustainable second-hand marketplace that helps people buy, sell, and donate pre-loved products.
Our goal is to:

Reduce waste

Promote a circular economy

Encourage responsible consumption

EcoFinds empowers users to list items, discover upcycled products, donate for free, and track the positive environmental impact (carbon footprint savings).

The Problem
Fast fashion, electronics waste, and consumerism are filling our landfills and harming the environment. Existing platforms are often profit-focused and lack true eco-conscious features.

The Solution
EcoFinds combines the simplicity of online resale with sustainability features:

Easy Buy & Sell ‚Äì List items under categories like books, electronics, fashion, and more.

Donation Option ‚Äì Give away items for free (price automatically set to 0).

Upcycle Category ‚Äì Showcase recycled and upcycled goods.

Carbon Credit Counter ‚Äì Estimate CO2 savings for each transaction using Climatiq API.

Seller Ratings ‚Äì Buyers can rate sellers (ensuring trust).

Interactive Filters ‚Äì Sort by price, new arrivals, seller rating, or nearest location.
